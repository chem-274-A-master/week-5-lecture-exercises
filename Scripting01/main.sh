# This script will run in an environment that contains
# an environment variable SECRET_FILENAME

# Write a script that takes any number of arguments. It then
# writes those arguments to a file with the name stored in that environment variable.
# each argument should be on its own line

# For example, if the SECRET_FILENAME variable is "output.txt", and you run
# main.sh alice bob charlie
#
# The the file "output.txt" should contain
# alice
# bob
# charlie
