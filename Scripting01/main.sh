# This replit contains an environment variable SECRET_NUMBER that contains
# a number.

# Create a script that reads the environment variable SECRET_NUMBER
# and then displays the corresponding file.

# For example, if the secret number is 2
# then you should display (cat) file2.txt

# tip: You can put variables inside of strings. Ie, "text${VAR}text".
# Just remember the curly braces!
