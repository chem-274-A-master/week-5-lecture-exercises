"""
This exercise tests your ability to inspect the global namespace.

Your task is to complete the function `find_variable_name` that takes in a variable value.
The function should return the name of the variable that has that value in the global namespace.

For example, if you have a variable `my_variable` with the value `"my_secret"`, the function should return `"my_variable"` 
when called with the value `"my_secret"`.

Fill in the function `find_variable_name` to complete this task.
